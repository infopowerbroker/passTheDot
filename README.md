# passTheDot.ash
KOL Peridot Peril sender

What does it do?
----------------
This script is a modification of PeKaJe's Zatara.ash

It takes the existing functionality and also checks to see if you have forseen your clannies' peril yet.

If you still have visions available, it will send them to statically assigned people (current clannies in OldCW's clan).

This script will not change much, so you shouldn't get too many updates wiping out your customization.

How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
git checkout https://github.com/infopowerbroker/passTheDot.git release
</pre>

Once it's installed, go to the Scripts menu, then select "passTheDot.ash". 

To update the script itself, run this command in the graphical CLI:

<pre>
git update
</pre>

This script supports multiple uses a day. It will only send consults the first time. Repeated usage will reply to consults sent to you.
